# Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. Each part operates independently and requires separate installation and setup.

## Frontend

The frontend is a web application responsible for providing the user interface. It's built using React and communicates with the backend via HTTP requests.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
```
cd frontend
```


2. **Install Dependencies:**
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn
```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
```
npm run dev
```
or
```
yarn dev
```

This will launch the frontend application, accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Backend

The backend handles data processing and serves API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
```
cd backend
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the backend server, listening on port 3001 by default.

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests for the backend service logic:
```
npm run test
```

or 

```
yarn test
```
